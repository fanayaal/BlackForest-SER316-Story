Strolling through Berlin, I saw a Hund (dog) slobbering and wagging its tail in front of a Gebaeck (pastries) store;
the Hund looked at me, then at the store, and back at me again.

I gulped, but kept my composure and reached slowly into my pocket. There I found a Apfelkuchen (Apple Cake) and with the speed of a Porsche I threw it at the Hund (dog). 

A BMW pulled over next to me to ask if I knew where the Baeckerei (bakery) was.

Since I was distracted, the hund had gobbled up the apfelkuchen and I found myself running down Hauptstrasse (Main street)!

As I rounded the corner, I plowed through a mound of muddy snow, smearing dirt all over my favorite lederhose (leather pants).
