Strolling through Berlin, I saw a Hund (dog) slobbering and wagging its tail in front of a Gebaeck (pastries) store;
the Hund looked at me, then at the store, and back at me again.

I gulped, but kept my composure and reached slowly into my pocket. There I found a Apfelkuchen (Apple Cake) and with the speed of a Porsche I threw it at the Hund (dog). 

A BMW pulled over next to me to ask if I knew where the Baeckerei (bakery) was.


"Excuse me!" the driver of the BMW called out while slowly driving next to me as I ran, "where's the nearest Biergarten (beer garden)?"

I am gluten-free and have no idea, so I said "down Hauptstrasse (Main street) next to the Schloss (castle)" knowing there was no castle.

While eating Bratwurst in Berlin, the Hund ran through the Biergarten like it owned the place.

Near Schloss Eltz, a Hund stared at my Doener like it was the real tourist attraction.

Both I and the Hund stood in awe at Till Lindemann, lead singer of Rammstein, buying Apfelkuchen.
