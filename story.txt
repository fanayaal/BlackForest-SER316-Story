Strolling through Berlin, I saw a Hund (dog) slobbering and wagging its tail in front of a Gebaeck (pastries) store;
the Hund looked at me, then at the store, and back at me again.

I gulped, but kept my composure and reached slowly into my pocket. There I found a Apfelkuchen (Apple Cake) and with the speed of a Porsche I threw it at the Hund (dog). 

A BMW pulled over next to me to ask if I knew where the Baeckerei (bakery) was.


"Excuse me!" the driver of the BMW called out while slowly driving next to me as I ran, "where's the nearest Biergarten (beer garden)?"

I am gluten-free and have no idea, so I said "down Hauptstrasse (Main street) next to the Schloss (castle)" knowing there was no castle.

The BMW driver nodded seriously, adjusted his Lederhose, and swore that he'd install a Klimaanlage in that Schloss himself if it meant reaching the Biergarten before the Hund demanded another Apfelkuchen.
