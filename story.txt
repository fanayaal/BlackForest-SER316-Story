Strolling through Berlin, I saw a Hund (dog) slobbering and wagging its tail in front of a Gebaeck (pastries) store;
the Hund looked at me, then at the store, and back at me again.

I gulped, but kept my composure and reached slowly into my pocket. There I found a Apfelkuchen (Apple Cake) and with the speed of a Porsche I threw it at the Hund (dog). 

A BMW pulled over next to me to ask if I knew where the Baeckerei (bakery) was.

Since I was distracted, the hund had gobbled up the apfelkuchen and I found myself running down Hauptstrasse (Main street)!

"Excuse me!" the driver of the BMW called out while slowly driving next to me as I ran, "where's the nearest Biergarten (beer garden)?"

I replied "ill only tell you if you buy me doener (Turkish kebab)" The driver then stepped out of the BMW with a beautiful dirndel (traditional dress) and said "All i have is an apfelkuchen(apple cake)".
